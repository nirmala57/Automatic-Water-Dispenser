# Automatic-Water-Dispenser
This project titled automatic water dispenser is a modern approach to the conventional water dispenser that we use in our daily life. In this system we use a proximity switch which is connected to a relay which controls the water solenoid which acts as a valve to control the water flow to the tap.
